About Dataset
FLO wants to set a roadmap for sales and marketing activities.

In order for the company to make a medium-long-term plan, it is necessary to estimate the potential value that existing customers will 
provide to the company in the future.

At this point, we will score and segment flo's products and offer special campaigns to customers in the segments we have allocated.

The dataset consists of information obtained from the past shopping behavior of customers who made their last purchases from OmniChannel 
(both online and offline) between 2020 and 2021.

Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in data analysis and machine learning, as it involves transforming 
raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis or model training. This process can include cleaning 
the data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values, as well as transforming 
the data by scaling or normalizing it, feature engineering, and selecting relevant variables. 
The goal of data preprocessing is to improve the quality of the data and reduce the noise, 
so that it can be analyzed effectively and used to develop accurate models that provide meaningful insights. 
Overall, data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data science project, as it can greatly impact the accuracy and effectiveness 
of the resulting models.

2. Creating the CLTV Data Structure
CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) is a metric that measures the total value of a customer's long-term relationship with a company. 
This value is obtained by subtracting the total costs incurred by the company during the customer's use of its products or services from
the total revenues generated by the customer for the company. A high CLTV indicates the success of a company's customer-centric approach.

3. BG/NBD, Establishment of Gamma-Gamma Models, Calculation of CLTV
BG/NBD is a probabilistic model that models customer purchase behavior. This model is used to predict the probability of customers making 
repeat purchases within a certain period. The model is based on customer behavior in terms of purchase frequency and purchase amounts, 
and uses this data to predict their future purchase behavior.

The Gamma-Gamma model is a statistical model used to estimate the expected monetary value (EMV) of customers for a company. 
This model is used in conjunction with the Pareto/NBD model and is based on the assumption that the variance of the transaction
values is proportional to the mean transaction value. The Gamma-Gamma model estimates the variance of the transaction values and allows 
for the calculation of the EMV, which is a measure of a customer's lifetime value in terms of the monetary value they bring to the company.

4. Creating Segments by CLTV
1CLTV segments refer to the grouping of customers based on their estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). These segments are used to identify 
and target customers with the highest potential value to the company. Common CLTV segments include high-value, medium-value, and low-value
customers, with each group having specific characteristics that can inform targeted marketing and retention strategies. By segmenting 
customers based on their CLTV, companies can allocate their resources more effectively and maximize the return on investment of their 
marketing efforts.
